## Color Scheme Descriptions

### Monochrome

The monochrome color scheme includes shades and tints of the base color. This creates a cohesive and harmonious look, with a consistent level of lightness or darkness.

### Monochrome (Dark)

The monochrome (dark) color scheme includes shades of the base color that are darker than the original. This is useful for creating a more dramatic and moody color scheme.

### Monochrome (Light)

The monochrome (light) color scheme includes tints of the base color that are lighter than the original. This creates a softer and more delicate color scheme.

### Analogic

The analogic color scheme includes colors that are adjacent to the base color on the color wheel. This creates a lively and vibrant color scheme that is well-suited for a variety of contexts.

### Complement

The complement color scheme includes the color that is opposite the base color on the color wheel. This creates a bold and contrasting color scheme.

### Analogic Complement

The analogic complement color scheme includes colors that are adjacent to the base color's complement on the color wheel. This creates a color scheme that is both harmonious and bold.
